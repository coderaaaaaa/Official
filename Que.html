        <div class="qa-item">
            <h3 class="question">Why was the Stamp Act important to the American Revolution?</h3>
            <p class="answer">It both extracted money from Americans without their consent, so both violated the principle of taxation without representation. Colonists rioted against the Stamp Act.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa-item">
            <h3 class="question">What happened as a result of the Stamp Act?</h3>
            <p class="answer">After the Stamp Act was passed, many colonists protested against it. They didn't want to pay the tax, so groups like the Sons of Liberty formed to fight back. People even attacked the homes of tax collectors. The protests got so big that the British government decided to cancel the Stamp Act the next year.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa-item">
            <h3 class="question">What did the Stamp Act accomplish?</h3>
            <p class="answer">The Stamp Act was supposed to help the British government make money to pay for soldiers in America. But instead of helping, it made the colonists more upset. It showed them that they needed to stand up for their rights and eventually led to the American Revolution.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa-item">
            <h3 class="question">How did the colonists respond to the Stamp Act?</h3>

They also boycotted British goods, which means they refused to buy them. This united many colonists, and they began to see themselves as one group fighting against British control.</p>
