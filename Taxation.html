        <p style="font-size: 27px;">The colonists argued that the act violated the British constitution because they were not represented in Parliament ("taxation without representation"). Additionally, the tax rates were higher in the colonies than in England, and the tax was payable in British sterling, which was difficult for the colonists to obtain.</p>
